## Goals

#### Construct a REST API request to accomplish a task given API documentation

#### Describe common usage patterns related to webhooks

#### Identify the constraints when consuming APIs

#### Explain common HTTP response codes associated with REST APIs

Usually the 200-class codes mean "OK," the 300-class codes mean "Something has moved," the 400-class codes mean "Not found, or you're not authorized", and 500-class codes mean a server-side error.


- 200 OK: The most common response code, indicating that the request was successful and the server has returned a normal response.
- 400 Bad Request: Maybe your JSON is malformed or the URL is incoherent.
- 401 Unauthorized: When a client attempts to access a protected resource without providing the necessary authentication or authorization information.
- 404 Not Found: A classic error, this code is returned when the requested resource cannot be found on the server-side.
- 500 Internal Server Error: This generic error code is often used when an unexpected problem occurs within the server that prevents it from fulfilling the request.


#### Troubleshoot a problem given the HTTP response code, request and API documentation
