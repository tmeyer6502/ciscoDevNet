The Cisco DevNet Associate DEVASC (200-901) [to be renamed Automating Networks Using Cisco Platforms (200-901 CCNAAUTO) in Feb 2026] exam covers software development and design topics for applications with Cisco platforms. Here are the main topic areas:

**1. Software Development and Design (15%)**
- Compare data formats (XML, JSON, YAML)
- Describe parsing of common data format to Python data structures
- Describe the concepts of test-driven development
- Compare software development methods (agile, lean, waterfall)
- Explain the benefits of organizing code into methods/functions, classes, and modules

**2. Understanding and Using APIs (20%)**
- Construct a REST API request to accomplish a task given API documentation
- Describe common usage patterns related to webhooks
- Identify the constraints when consuming APIs
- Explain common HTTP response codes associated with REST APIs
- Troubleshoot a problem given the HTTP response code, request and API documentation

**3. Cisco Platforms and Development (15%)**
- Construct a Python script that uses a Cisco SDK given SDK documentation
- Describe the capabilities of Cisco network management platforms and APIs
- Describe the capabilities of Cisco compute management platforms and APIs
- Describe the capabilities of Cisco collaboration platforms and APIs
- Describe the capabilities of Cisco security platforms and APIs

**4. Application Deployment and Security (15%)**
- Describe benefits of edge computing
- Identify attributes of different application deployment models
- Identify the attributes of these application deployment types
- Describe components for a CI/CD pipeline in application deployments
- Construct a Python unit test

**5. Infrastructure and Automation (20%)**
- Describe the value of model driven programmability for infrastructure automation
- Compare controller-level and device-level management
- Describe the use and roles of network simulation and test tools
- Describe the components and benefits of CI/CD pipeline in infrastructure automation
- Describe principles of infrastructure as code

**6. Network Fundamentals (15%)**
- Describe the purpose and usage of MAC addresses and VLANs
- Describe the purpose and usage of IP addresses, routes, subnet mask/prefix, and gateways
- Describe the function of common networking components
- Interpret a basic network topology diagram with elements such as network devices, cable types, and connectors
- Describe the function of management, data, and control planes in a network device

The exam focuses heavily on Python programming, REST APIs, JSON/XML data formats, and automation concepts across Cisco's various platforms.
