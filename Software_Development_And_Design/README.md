## Describe the concepts of test-driven development ##

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development methodology where you write tests before writing the actual code. It follows a simple three-step cycle:

### The TDD Cycle (Red-Green-Refactor) ###

1. **Red**: Write a failing test for the functionality you want to implement
2. **Green**: Write the minimal code needed to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Clean up and improve the code while keeping tests passing

## Key Principles

- **Tests first**: Always write the test before the implementation
- **Small steps**: Make incremental changes with frequent test runs
- **Minimal code**: Write only enough code to pass the current test
- **Continuous refactoring**: Improve code structure without changing behavior

## Benefits

- **Better design**: Forces you to think about interfaces and requirements upfront
- **Higher confidence**: Comprehensive test coverage catches regressions
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of expected behavior
- **Faster debugging**: Failing tests quickly pinpoint issues
- **Reduced bugs**: Catches edge cases and integration issues early





### Compare software development methods (agile, lean, waterfall) ###

Here's a good piece of reading: https://www.overcode.tech/blog/software-development-methodologies

Agile:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development

The Agile Manifesto: https://agilemanifesto.org/


Lean: It centers around waste elimination, learning, optimization, and delivering in small batches.

Waterfall: Gates, timelines, milestones, phased development

### Explain the benefits of organizing code into methods/functions, classes, and modules ###
